          <h1>Deadlift Basics</h1>
          <h2 id="dip">How to Deadlift</h2>
          <p>The “dead” in Deadlift stands for dead weight. So every rep must start on the floor, from a dead stop. You don’t Deadlift top-down like on the Squat or Bench Press. You start at the bottom, pull the weight up and then return it to the floor. Here are the five steps to Deadlift with proper form… </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Walk to the bar. <br> 
              Stand with your mid-foot under the bar. Your shins shouldn’t touch it yet. As a standard stand with your feet at shoulder with apart. You can also experiment with the foot placement, some stand a bit wider and some a bit closer, but see what works best for you.  </li>

            <li>Grab the bar. <br> 
              Bend over without bending your legs. Grip the bar narrow, about shoulder-width apart like on the Overhead Press. Your arms must be vertical when looking from the front.</li>

            <li>Bend your knees. <br> 
              Drop into position by bending your knees until your shins touch the bar. Do NOT let the bar move away from your mid-foot. If it moves, start from scratch with step one.</li>

            <li>Lift your chest. <br> 
              Straighten your back by raising you chest. Do not change your position – keep the bar over your mid-foot, your shins against the bar, and your hips where they are.</li>

            <li>Pull. <br> 
              Take a big breath, hold it and stand up with the weight. Keep the bar in contact with your legs while you pull. Don’t shrug or lean back at the top. Lock your hips and knees.</li>
          </ol> 
          <h1 id="mc">Main Deadlift cues queues</h1>
          <p>Before every Deadlift you can remember theese cues to ensure you keep good form all the way through the lift</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Hips out Breast out</li>
            <li>Pits to pockets</li>
            <li>Keep the bar near and it wont hurt your rear</li>
          </ol>

        <h1 id="mw">The muscles have worked...</h1>
        <p>Deadlifts work your whole body. Your legs are the prime movers. Your back muscles keep your spine neutral. And your arms keep the bar in your hands. But since the weight is heavier than on any other exercise, every other muscles has to work too. Otherwise you can’t Deadlift the weight.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Legs. <br> 
            Your hamstrings and glutes straighten your hips. Your quads straighten your knees. Your calves straighten your ankles. The range of motion is smaller than on Squats since you start in a half Squat position. But the weight is heavier and starts from a harder dead stop.</li>

          <li>Back. <br>Your back muscles contract to keep your spine neutral while gravity tries to bend it. Your lats keep the weight close to your body so it doesn’t drift away. Deadlifts are the best back-builder because they work your whole back with heavier weights than any other exercise.</li>

          <li>Traps. <br>
            Your trapezius muscles contract to keep you shoulders in place and transfer force to the bar. Even your shoulders and chest muscles contract to add support. The heavier you Deadlift, the harder your traps work, the bigger they become. You don’t need to do shrugs.</li>

          <li>Abs. <br> 
            Your abdominal muscles and obliques contract to support your lower back. The heavier your Deadlifts, the stronger and more muscular the become. Eat right and they’ll show.</li>

          <li>Arms.  <br> 
            Your hands hold the bar tight. This strengthens your grip and forearms. But everything upstream tightens as well during heavy Deadlifts, including your biceps and triceps. They don’t bend but work isometrically, like your lower back, to hold your body in position.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deadlifts work your whole body. Your legs are the prime movers. Your back muscles keep your spine neutral. And your arms keep the bar in your hands. But since the weight is heavier than on any other exercise, every other muscles has to work too. Otherwise you can’t Deadlift the weight.<br> <br></p>

        <h1 id="op">Optional Equipment <br> to help/improve your squats</h1>
        <a href="https://www.gymgrossisten.no/powerlifting-belt-xs/BE002-001-XS.html"><img src="/billed/dbssquatbelt.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <h2 id="b">Belt:</h2>
        <p>Using a lifting belt during squats can provide several benefits for lifters. Primarily, a lifting belt offers support and stability to the lower back and core muscles, which are crucial for maintaining proper form and spinal alignment during heavy lifts. By increasing intra-abdominal pressure, the belt helps to stabilize the spine, reducing the risk of injury and allowing the lifter to lift heavier loads with greater confidence. Additionally, wearing a lifting belt can enhance proprioception, providing a tactile cue for maintaining proper posture throughout the squat movement. While it's essential to use proper lifting technique and not rely solely on the belt for support, incorporating a lifting belt into your squat routine can be beneficial for lifters looking to maximize their performance and minimize the risk of injury.</p>
    
        <a href="https://www.gymgrossisten.no/powerlifting-belt-xs/BE002-001-XS.html"><img src="/billed/dbsstraps.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <h2 id="s">Straps:</h2>
        <p>
          Using straps during deadlifts offers several advantages. Firstly, they improve grip strength, especially beneficial during heavy lifts or high-volume sessions. This allows lifters to focus on engaging targeted muscle groups without worrying about grip fatigue. Additionally, straps enhance muscle engagement by ensuring a secure grip throughout the movement, leading to better isolation and activation of muscles like the back, glutes, and hamstrings. Moreover, they reduce the risk of injury by preventing accidents caused by grip fatigue and maintaining proper form. Straps also enable lifters to increase training volume and push past plateaus by lifting heavier weights or performing more repetitions. However, it's crucial to remember that while straps are beneficial, they shouldn't replace grip-specific training entirely, especially for beginners.</p>
        <a href="https://www.gymgrossisten.no/powerlifting-belt-xs/BE002-001-XS.html"><img src="/billed/dbssquatshoes.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <h2 id="ls">Lifting shoes:</h2>
        <p>
          Lifting shoes are a valuable tool for deadlift due to their specialized design tailored to weightlifting movements. These shoes typically feature a raised heel, which promotes a more upright torso position during the squat, allowing for better depth and stability. The solid, non-compressible sole of lifting shoes provides a stable base, enhancing balance and reducing the risk of injury by preventing foot collapse under heavy loads. Additionally, the straps or laces on lifting shoes ensure a secure fit, minimizing the risk of slipping or shifting during the squat movement. By optimizing foot positioning and stability, lifting shoes contribute to improved squat mechanics and overall performance, making them a popular choice among serious lifters aiming to maximize their strength gains and minimize the risk of injury.</p>
