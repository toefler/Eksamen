            <h1>Squat Basics</h1>
            <h2>How to Squat</h2>
            <p>
              Remember to breathe steadily throughout the movement, inhaling as
              you lower into the squat and exhaling as you rise back up. Focus
              on maintaining proper form and alignment throughout the exercise
              to maximize its effectiveness and minimize the risk of injury. If
              you're new to squatting, it's a good idea to start with bodyweight
              squats and gradually add weight as you become more comfortable
              with the movement.
            </p>

            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                Setup: <br />
                Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned
                out. Engage your core muscles by pulling your belly button in
                towards your spine. Keep your chest up and your back straight,
                with your shoulders pulled back and down.
              </li>
              <li>
                Initiate the Movement: <br />
                Begin the squat by hinging at your hips and pushing your
                buttocks back as if you're sitting into a chair. Shift your
                weight onto your heels while keeping your knees in line with
                your toes.
              </li>

              <li>
                Lowering Phase: <br />
                Continue to lower your body by bending your knees, keeping your
                chest up and your back straight. Aim to lower down until your
                thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can
                comfortably go while maintaining proper form.
              </li>

              <li>
                Rising Phase: <br />
                Push through your heels to straighten your legs and return to
                the starting position. Keep your core engaged and maintain an
                upright posture throughout the movement.
              </li>

              <li>
                Completion: <br />
                Once you reach the top, squeeze your glutes at the top of the
                movement to fully extend your hips. Pause briefly before
                starting the next repetition.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <!--Squat cues-->
            <h1 id="mc">Main Squat Cues</h1>
            <p>
              Before every squat you can remember theese cues to ensure you keep
              good form all the way through the lift
            </p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Big breath</li>

            </ol>

            <h1 id="mw">The muscles have worked...</h1>
            <p>
              Squats work your legs!. Your legs are the prime movers. ButÂ since
              the weight is heavier than on any other exercise, your lower back
              and some other muscles has to work too. Otherwise you canât squat
              the weight.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Quadriceps: <br />The quadriceps, located at the front of the
                thigh, are the primary muscles responsible for extending the
                knee joint during the upward phase of the squat.
              </li>

              <li>
                Gluteus Maximus: <br />The gluteus maximus, the largest muscle
                in the buttocks, is heavily engaged during squats to extend the
                hip joint and drive the body back to the starting position.
              </li>

              <li>
                Hamstrings: <br />The hamstrings, located at the back of the
                thigh, act as synergists to the gluteus maximus, aiding in hip
                extension and knee flexion during the lowering phase of the
                squat.
              </li>

              <li>
                Erector Spinae: <br />The erector spinae muscles, which run
                along the spine, stabilize the spine and help maintain an
                upright posture throughout the squat movement, preventing
                forward leaning or rounding of the back.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These muscles are considered prime movers because they are
              primarily responsible for generating movement during the squat
              exercise, making them essential for squatting with proper form and
              efficiency.<br />

            <h2 id="b">Belt:</h2>
            <p>
              Using a lifting belt during squats can provide several benefits
              for lifters. Primarily, a lifting belt offers support and
              stability to the lower back and core muscles, which are crucial
              for maintaining proper form and spinal alignment during heavy
              lifts. By increasing intra-abdominal pressure, the belt helps to
              stabilize the spine, reducing the risk of injury and allowing the
              lifter to lift heavier loads with greater confidence.
              Additionally, wearing a lifting belt can enhance proprioception,
              providing a tactile cue for maintaining proper posture throughout
              the squat movement. While it's essential to use proper lifting
              technique and not rely solely on the belt for support,
              incorporating a lifting belt into your squat routine can be
              beneficial for lifters looking to maximize their performance and
              minimize the risk of injury.
            </p>

            <h2 id="ks">Knee sleeves:</h2>
            <p>
              Knee sleeves are commonly used during squats to provide support
              and stability to the knee joint. They work by compressing the
              joint and surrounding tissues, which can help reduce strain and
              alleviate discomfort during heavy lifts. By increasing blood flow
              and warmth to the knees, knee sleeves may also aid in preventing
              injury and promoting faster recovery. Additionally, the
              compression provided by knee sleeves can enhance proprioception,
              helping lifters maintain proper knee alignment throughout the
              squat movement. While knee sleeves should not be used as a
              substitute for proper lifting technique or addressing underlying
              mobility issues, incorporating them into your squat routine can
              offer added support and protection, especially during
              high-intensity training sessions.
            </p>

            <h2 id="ss">Lifting shoes:</h2>
            <p>
              Lifting shoes are a valuable tool for squatting due to their
              specialized design tailored to weightlifting movements. These
              shoes typically feature a raised heel, which promotes a more
              upright torso position during the squat, allowing for better depth
              and stability. The solid, non-compressible sole of lifting shoes
              provides a stable base, enhancing balance and reducing the risk of
              injury by preventing foot collapse under heavy loads.
              Additionally, the straps or laces on lifting shoes ensure a secure
              fit, minimizing the risk of slipping or shifting during the squat
              movement. By optimizing foot positioning and stability, lifting
              shoes contribute to improved squat mechanics and overall
              performance, making them a popular choice among serious lifters
              aiming to maximize their strength gains and minimize the risk of
              injury.
