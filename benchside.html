          <h1>Bench In Depth</h1>
          <h2>How to Bench</h2>
          <p>Remember to breathe steadily throughout the movement, inhaling as you lower into the squat and exhaling as you rise back up. Focus on maintaining proper form and alignment throughout the exercise to maximize its effectiveness and minimize the risk of injury. If you're new to squatting, it's a good idea to start with bodyweight squats and gradually add weight as you become more comfortable with the movement.</p>

          <ol type="1">
            <li>Setup: <br>
               Begin by lying down on a bench, ensuring your back is flat against it. Grip the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, making sure your thumbs wrap around the bar. Plant your feet firmly on the ground for stability, with your eyes positioned directly under the bar to help maintain a proper lifting trajectory.
            </li>

            <li>Unrack and Lowering Phase:<br> 
               Lift the barbell off the rack with controlled strength, ensuring it remains directly above your chest. Lower the bar in a controlled manner towards your mid-chest, maintaining a slight arch in your lower back to ensure stability. Keep your elbows at approximately a 45-degree angle relative to your torso as the bar descends. Aim to lower the bar until it lightly touches your chest, avoiding bouncing or allowing the elbows to flare excessively.</li>

            <li>Bottom Position:<br> 
               Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement, ensuring the bar lightly touches your chest without sinking or losing tension in your upper body. Maintain a stable position with your feet planted, core engaged, and wrists straight to prevent unnecessary strain.</li>

            <li>Pressing Phase: <br>
               Drive the barbell upwards explosively by extending your arms, exhaling as you push. Maintain control throughout the ascent, focusing on pushing through the heels of your palms while keeping your elbows slightly tucked to maintain shoulder stability. Extend your arms fully at the top of the movement without locking your elbows.</li>

            <li>Reracking and Safety: <br>
               Once you've completed the desired number of repetitions, retract your shoulder blades and guide the barbell back to the rack with control. Ensure the bar is securely placed on the rack before releasing your grip. Always prioritize safety by using a spotter, especially with heavy weights, and consider using safety bars or a power rack to prevent accidents. Focus on maintaining proper form throughout each phase of the exercise to maximize effectiveness and minimize the risk of injury.</li>
          </ol> 


          <!--Squat cues-->
          <h1 id="mc">Main Bench Cues</h1>
          <p>Before every Bench you can remember theese cues to ensure you keep good form all the way through the lift</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>45 degrees no injuries</li>
            <li>right under your nips keeps you from hurting your hips</li>
            <li>feet on the ground, and the back a bit round</li>
          </ol>
        
          <h1>The muscles have worked...</h1>
          <p>Bench pressing works your Chest and arms!. Your chest is the prime mover. But since you use your arms to press the weight the arms are used also. Otherwise you canât bench the weight.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pectoralis Major: <br>
              The pectoralis major, located in the chest area, is the primary muscle responsible for the pressing motion during the bench press. It contracts to bring the upper arms closer to the midline of the body, effectively pushing the barbell away from the chest.
              </li>

            <li>Deltoids (Anterior): <br>
              The anterior deltoids, or front shoulder muscles, assist the pectoralis major in moving the arms forward and upward during the bench press. They stabilize the shoulder joint and contribute significantly to the initial phase of pressing the barbell off the chest.</li>

            <li>Triceps Brachii: <br>
              The triceps brachii, located at the back of the upper arm, play a crucial role in extending the elbows during the bench press. As the barbell is pressed upward, the triceps contract to straighten the arms and complete the lifting motion</li>

            <li>Serratus Anterior: <br>
              The serratus anterior muscles are located on the sides of the chest and ribs. They stabilize the shoulder blades against the rib cage during the bench press, ensuring proper shoulder movement and stability throughout the exercise. They also assist in protracting (moving forward) the shoulder blades during the pressing motion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These muscles are considered prime movers because they are primarily responsible for generating movement during the Bench exercise, making them essential for benching with proper form and efficiency.<br> <br></p>

          <h2 id="es">Elbow Sleeves:</h2>
          <p>Using a lifting belt during squats can provide several benefits for lifters. Primarily, a lifting belt offers support and stability to the lower back and core muscles, which are crucial for maintaining proper form and spinal alignment during heavy lifts. By increasing intra-abdominal pressure, the belt helps to stabilize the spine, reducing the risk of injury and allowing the lifter to lift heavier loads with greater confidence. Additionally, wearing a lifting belt can enhance proprioception, providing a tactile cue for maintaining proper posture throughout the squat movement. While it's essential to use proper lifting technique and not rely solely on the belt for support, incorporating a lifting belt into your squat routine can be beneficial for lifters looking to maximize their performance and minimize the risk of injury.</p>
          <a href="https://www.gymgrossisten.no/powerlifting-belt-xs/BE002-001-XS.html"><img src="/billed/dbswristwraps.jpg" alt=""></a>
          <h2 id="ws">Wrist Wraps:</h2>
          <p> Knee sleeves are commonly used during squats to provide support and stability to the knee joint. They work by compressing the joint and surrounding tissues, which can help reduce strain and alleviate discomfort during heavy lifts. By increasing blood flow and warmth to the knees, knee sleeves may also aid in preventing injury and promoting faster recovery. Additionally, the compression provided by knee sleeves can enhance proprioception, helping lifters maintain proper knee alignment throughout the squat movement. While knee sleeves should not be used as a substitute for proper lifting technique or addressing underlying mobility issues, incorporating them into your squat routine can offer added support and protection, especially during high-intensity training sessions.</p>
